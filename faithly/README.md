# Project Idea: Faithly – Daily Verses App

## Overview

Faithly is a cross-platform application (available on both mobile and desktop) designed to help users stay connected with their faith in their busy daily lives. The app fetches and delivers daily verses or teachings from various major religious texts—including the Qur'an, Bhagavad Gita, Bible, and others—directly to users via notifications. Each notification includes 1-2 verses along with their meanings or interpretations, making it easy for users to reflect on spiritual wisdom even when they have little time.

## Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced world, many people find it challenging to dedicate time to reading religious scriptures regularly. As a result, they may feel disconnected from their spiritual practices and miss out on the guidance and comfort these texts provide.

## Solution

Faithly addresses this issue by providing a simple, non-intrusive way for users to receive daily spiritual nourishment. By sending short, meaningful excerpts from various religious texts, the app encourages users to pause, reflect, and reconnect with their faith, regardless of how busy their schedules are.
