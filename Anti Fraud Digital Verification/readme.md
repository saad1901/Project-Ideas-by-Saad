## WHAT
in the name of religion, many frauds are happening, and there is no way to actually
veriify them via Centralized Database.

## HOW
the employees/ people asking for Donation, will be required to generate their/ or their Organization's identity via this central application
and get it verified by the District/Village level Appointed Authority

Right now the idea is being implemented for the Islamic Madarsa Fund/ Donation collection, and later on many such different organizations can be added,

## Flow
so particularly in terms of Madarsa, there are district level authorities, looking after the progress, so the responsibility will be assigned to each of them to
1. Add the verified Known and True organization into the database, by their Interface
2. verify the employees, ensuring correct data is being uploaded by the organization

once the verification is done, the employees will have an digital identity, it will
contain NAME, CONTACT NUMBER, LAST 4 Adhar Digits.

uptil now, the process will help the authorities to verify the person

FOR the people, who wishes to donate, they can verify and see the digital profile of
that organization via UNIQUE ID , that is system generated for each employee/ Madarsa.
they can either carry an website redirecting QR code for ease of use
or they can just took the DIGITAL verified printout and showcase at the time of collection of funds.

this project is solely aimed for the charity, and will not incur any development charges
from Higher Bodies

for the application to scale well, the proper web hosting (preferably AWS) should be
used, and this would be only cost to pay for this system to work,
